France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great service and wine but inedible food,Mar 2023 •,"Sadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.
Never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again.
Ad Hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional.
Maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and , as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, noticed plates of  precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates. If it had been the odd dish that disappointed, we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it. As it was every plate of food was not hot, bland, lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a while.l
All the serving staff were great as was the wine but I failed to finish any plate offered. 
The tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine.
When asked ,I admitted , with that great English understatement, that I had been disappointed. I found 17 euros had been deducted from the 190 euro bill so it was nice that they noticed.
Probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course.

I feel responsible that I made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists. 
An expensive mistake.","Great service and wine but inedible food Sadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly ever,Nov 2022 •,"From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu. Plonked some truffles on the table and then with no explanation of how they would enhance the dishes gave us a rehearsed speech which she proceeded to repeat word for word at every single table. If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations. But the worst part of the meal was my husbands inedible medallions of ‘lamb’ dish. This was made up of a tiny amount of lamb gristle and fat wrapped around some mushy stuff we couldn’t identify. Fillet of beef was sort of well cooked (frankly hard to get wrong) but served with exactly the same sauce as the lamb, some reconstituted mash in strange tube shapes and tasteless, watery spinach. We asked for wine recommendations. The wines were ok but we weren’t told what they were, they weren’t explained to us (I had to ask what mine was and was told it was ‘local’) and we weren’t offered any to try. With so much choice nearby and so many better (and much cheaper options) I’d avoid.","Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly ever From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!",Jul 2021 •,"We visited this restaurant on Saturday night and we had the most disappointing service and food experience ever. It was my partner's bday celebration weekend. 

The restaurant is run by a blonde Manager and her daughter wich had the most terrible attitude, they both made sure we will never be back there.
We were sitting at the table near the window but the ac was off and outside about 35 degrees. Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.
The young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.
So we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty? 
Finally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.
I have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.

The tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.
The wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.

Food was good but if you are used to first-class and fine dining service keep out from this place!","Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,all around awful,May 2019 •,"My wife and I booked well in advance based on TA reviews. We were seated as we arrived and the interior was wonderful. We each ordered the pumpkin flower stuffed with cheese. They arrived about 30 minutes later stone cold and tasted like hard potato chips stuffed with a glob of cheese. We ate about 20% and told the waitress, who never came back to check, when she came to clear the plates that is was awful. She argued with us saying""well, that is how we make it."" About another 30 minutes passed and our second course arrive, again stone cold-it was a pasta dish that was way under cooked, not just al dente. We did not eat more than a few bites but sat there for about 20 minutes until someone came by to clear the plates-we told her that the food was not edible and asked for our waitress--after sitting for about 10-15 more minutes we decided to get up an leave-the waitress never appeared until we started to walk out and then she said our main course was ready. This was 2 hours after we arrived. We paid for the first two course even though a classy restaurant would not have charged at all, and walked out. The waitress was rude and the food awful and the service even worse.","all around awful My wife and I booked well in advance based on TA reviews.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A big disappointment due to poor service and arrogant attitudes,Mar 2019 •,"Rome

A big disappointment--not service-oriented and arrogant.

I had high expectations for this restaurant, but when we got there, it turned out that they had put our party of 6 at a very large table for 8 completely off on its own at the back of the restaurant. The table was not conducive to good conversation and very awkward. When we asked for another table, our concerns were dismissed. When I wrote to the restaurant afterwards to complain about the situation, I got a very dismissive letter back from the owner, essentially stating: ""other people love this table; I guess you didn't."" No apology was offered.   Particularly given the price, I would not recommend this restaurant to others based on the poor treatment we received particularly given the many other wonderful alternatives in Rome.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing,Sept 2018 •,"With so many complimentary reviews I was expecting so much more. The service so praised in other reviews was robotic and slow....Very slow. Our reservation was for 21:00. Our table wasn't ready, so we were invited to have a glass of prosecco in the bar. This was fine but we waited half an hour for the table. Once we got to the table we waited 20 minutes or so to have our order taken, although to be fair we were offered another glass of prosecco. We eventually got our amuse bouche at around 22:00 at least an hour after we arrived. 

We ordered the truffle set menu. The food ranged between being average and quite good, never really good. At odds with other reviews a few words of warning. The truffle menu is a poor choice. Truffle is delicious but a whole meal with the same flavour doesn't work. Second unless you are very hungry avoid the menus. The volume of food is enormous. We left quite a lot of the anti pasti and especially the pasta course. 

We eventually left around midnight. They clearly book more covers than they can efficiently deal with. 

My summary is...quantity rather than quality and slow robotic emotionless service probably caused by over booking.","Disappointing With so many complimentary reviews I was expecting so much more.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,What a disaster...,Oct 2018 •,"I have to say that I was disappointed in my visit to Ad Hoc. While the location and decor were great I found the service to be terrible, in fact the service made the food a disappointment as well. 

It started with the 40 minute wait in between sitting down and a staff member our order for food or drinks. Our waitress seemed disappointed we didn't want to do the tasting menu, but we were already disappointed with the way the meal had started. It took another 30 minutes for our first glass of wine and burrata appetizer to arrive at the table. 

The burrata with the upgrade of white truffle. This dish was around $50, and when it arrived a small fly landed on it... No big deal it happens. When the waitress and I tried to get it off it was killed on the cheese. She asked if we wanted a new one... um, of course I said. Now after waiting 30 minutes for the dish to arrive at our table a ""new one"" was brought out in less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure that the 2nd burrata was new and that they threw away the original dish, given how expensive white truffles are, but it should have been. 

The 3 way carbonara came out practically cold too. No one ever came to see if we wanted another drink until the end of our meal. When we ordered wine glasses were just brought over a glass, no wine was ever presented to the table as with other restaurants in this price range. Some staff apologized at one point saying the service issues were because they were busy, I'm not sure how that was my problem. They hold themselves out as a fine dining experience and at least mine was far, far from that. I would tell you to ignore the inflated reviews and look for something better.","What a disaster...

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Utterly inept in every way,May 2018 •,"And pretentious to go along with it.  What can you say about a restaurant that provides separate wine lists for red and white that look like copies of War and Peace?  Except that there are two wines per page, and they aren’t listed by country of origin, or varietal type – they’re listed by what someone (God knows who) thinks is the type.  Who would have guessed a Chianti Classico is a “full bodied red”?  Certainly no one who knows wine.  In any normal restaurant this wine list would run maybe 6 or 7 pages at the most.  Apparently wines by the glass are a state secret, you have to ask if they have them.   

Rubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.

Appallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.  They seem to be totally confused about everything.    And 160 euros for the experience.  There is a traditional Italian restaurant about two doors up that was packed.  Ad Hoc wasn’t.  I can see why.","Utterly inept in every way And pretentious to go along with it.

Who would have guessed a Chianti Classico is a “full bodied red”?  Certainly no one who knows wine.  In any normal restaurant this wine list would run maybe 6 or 7 pages at the most.  Apparently wines by the glass are a state secret, you have to ask if they have them.   

Rubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.

Appallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.  They seem to be totally confused about everything.    And 160 euros for the experience.  There is a traditional Italian restaurant about two doors up that was packed.  Ad Hoc wasn’t.  I can see why.",0,utterly inept every way pretentious go along what can you say about restaurant that provides separate wine lists red white that look like copies war peace except that there are two wines per page they arent listed by country origin varietal type theyre listed by what someone god knows who thinks type who would have guessed chianti classico full bodied red certainly no one who knows wine any normal restaurant wine list would run maybe pages most apparently wines by glass are state secret you have ask if they have them rubbery overcooked octopus brittle fried pumpkin flowers devoid taste topped cold ricotta filet that could only be described as lowend usda choice from chain steakhouse us also rubbery tasteless least fish cooked properly but lying hockey puck warm wilted spinach appallingly bad service one hour get appetizer they seem be totally confused about everything euros experience there traditional italian restaurant about two doors up that packed ad hoc wasnt i can see why

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,2 hours of disappointment,Aug 2017 •,"Came here based off of TripAdvisor reviews and I'm debating deleting the app as it's clear the people who rate this place highly are delusional.

I'll start by saying that the hospitality and staff was amongst the best I received during my 10 stop Italian tour. The free glass of wine, the free pre desert and the free bottle of house olive oil was appreciated and the staff were excellent in every way especially the bald waiter with the blue eyes who was amazing at his job but the food was total crap!

We each got the black truffle tasting menu, it was our last night so we decided to splash out a bit and the table behind us (an American family) also got the black truffle tasting menu. The starters were ok. 2 of them were the same but one had basil and the beef tartar was bland.

The truffle carbonara was very nice, but the spaghetti dish was average. The ox cheek was tough with a sirloin type fat down one side. At this time the table behind us got a steak and we noticed them complaining that it was tough so it wasn't just us. For this reason I believe the meat to be poorly sourced. The duck however was decent.

The deserts were all crap, we actually didn't finish them. Meanwhile the Americans on the table behind us were blown away by the same dishes we disliked which leads me to believe that the reviews of this place are mostly by Americans ""visiting Europe"". 

I never know which reviews to trust so if you're reading this take the opinion of someone who has eaten at Michelin star restaurants around the world and has a knack for finding hidden gems, this place, in a nut shell, the food is below average with truffle on top. The service and hospitality is excellent but you can't eat good service. Presentation was also excellent, however id say avoid this place.","2 hours of disappointment Came here based off of TripAdvisor reviews and I'm debating deleting the app as it's clear the people who rate this place highly are delusional.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Regrettable food-- cold pasta carbonara in Rome,Jun 2017 •,"I don't write negative reviews. I'd rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and I've worked in food and know how tough it can be. But one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this. I hope I save someone who really wants to experience good Roman food from disappointment (and it's not hard to find good food in Rome!).  First, this is tourist food; upscale to be sure. The focus on truffles is not really representative of Roman cuisine (if that's what you what).  You can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places. I could tolerate that--it is what it is-- had our food been served appropriately.I went for the Roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well. My partner went for the land menu. Both suffered the same problem.  Some of this food was cooked way ahead. That can be done with some things but not others. Dishes that should have been hot were served cold. I'm talking cold gummy pasta carbonara, people! Another dish--intended to be hot- was warm in one part and not just cold but ice cold in another. That is just not excusable. Service this evening was also chaotic, but I felt bad for the 3 young women who were dealing with some 8-10 top  tourist groups and only one of them seemed to be a professional server. I've been coming to Rome for 30 years and I have NEVER experienced anything like this. We decided to pay and leave after the pasta debacle (I actually sent it back and waited 45 minutes for the server to return with a replacement--never happened), even though we weren't halfway through the fixed menu. The poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay. I'm hoping this was a problematic evening and won't occur again, although I'm pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead (fried foods much be served subito-- the fritti were lukewarm going on cold) or the food isn't getting from kitchen to table promptly. I should have known better, but I trusted reviews and even recommendations from travel advisors I know. If you are planning for this to be your splurge in Rome, you might think twice about it. My advice: go simple in Rome; it's almost always good if not great.","Regrettable food-- cold pasta carbonara in Rome I don't write negative reviews.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Far behind expectations - what did we miss?,Jun 2017 •,"After several recommendations, and a quick read through on TA feedbacks - we booked Ad Hoc for our last night in Rome. We are both global travelers, and we know a good restaurant from a great. This ended up as neither of the two.
We arrived with expectations, and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table. The interior is inviting - with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling. Prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either.
We received the menu, and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu - despite being slightly off season. We went with full wine pairing, and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff...
The one thing that surprised us the most, was the constant waiting(which we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well) There was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses, and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake. The wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served, but in small servings. With 30 minutes to the next course, and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks. Weird!
Food? Started off well with a variety of starters. Cheese, deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners - the starter was heavy...but rather pleasant. Last one on the plate was a beef tartare. Unseasoned, as they felt we should season by taste ourselves... What???
Pasta course was a duo of pastas. Both creamy and cheesy and heavy - loaded with truffle shavings. I'd loved it if this was the only heavy course, but already by now - the meal is loosing balance. There are no vegetables, and no acidity to balance the weight of cream/cheese/truffles.
Main course. Duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles. Duck breast - cold and rubbery. Beef cheek - cold and tasteless(salty if anything at all) We sent it back, and started to loose patience.
Decided to wait for desserts. All good, but guess what - all creamy and heavy! A fresh sorbet could have saved half the day, but was unfortunately not part of the game.
All in all - I can only recommend the wines served(although served in a strange way...bottles were never brought to the table?)
We had the main courses removed from our bill - which helped on our mood...although I took that more or less for granted.
Sorry to say - this experience is no where near our top 10 in Rome...","Far behind expectations - what did we miss?

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rip-off in Ripetta street: the most over-rated restaurant ever.,Jan 2017 •,"We (my wife, my son and I) had a terrible experience in ad-hoc on Thursday 5 January 2017. It is a miracle that this restaurant is in the Roma top 100 with such poor food, atmosphere, attitude, service, organisation, heating, etc...Only the wine was good. We had far far far better experiences during our stay in Roma, including at Babette, which is in the same area.
We booked by phone the day before for three and arrived on time at 800pm. We were seated in the room on the right side when you enter the restaurant and we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible (and working) heating system. There were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room. We complained to the head waitress (the boss?) who said they have a problem with the door (in fact, even when the door was completly closed, the issue with the temperature was more or less the same) and said she will do her best to move us to another table. This did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be 30 minutes. At the end of the dinner (during which my wife kept her coat...) we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said (believe it or not): ""because it is a table for four and you are only three""....translation: i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to over-promise for this.
Generally speaking we found that the head waitress (the boss?) overpromised on everything during this dinner...and under-delivered.
Regarding food, the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing. We would rate the food somewhere between ""nothing special"" for the pasta and ""bad"" for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare. We noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef.
The Tuscany red wine was good...but do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a Chateau Petrus 1982?
The service was very very long...it took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed.
When we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill, the head waitress (the boss?) asked about our feeling. We told us exactly what was our view: big problem with the temperature, no transfer to the other table when it was available, nothing special (at best) with the food and good wine. She said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confused...More a bad actress than a good head waitress (or a boss?).
The bill included a 10% discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet booking...but we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at €30 vs €25. Based on other reviews, we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle. This was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this.
Finally, when we asked for our coats, a waitress gave us a probably very expensive Moncler down jacket...which was not belonging to us. Imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we are...Don't go there with expensive coats!
Never again! and FYI we are used to go to all sort of restaurants privately or because of our jobs, from small local restaurants to 3* Michelin restaurants (see our other reviews) and we believe we are able to make the difference between good and bad food, good and bad service, etc...","Rip-off in Ripetta street: the most over-rated restaurant ever.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing dinner,Oct 2016 •,"This restaurant was recommended to us by two different people and while they must have had a good experience, we did not. 

It took 30 minutes to get our order taken. The server did apologize for the delay but the incredibly slow pace continued. 

45 minutes into our visit, we received bread. 1/2 of the bread was very dry and without much taste/flavour. 

On two occasions the server said our dinner would be coming right away but it never did. It took almost 3 hours before the main course was served. My husband ordered the Sea Tasting Menu and I had the Land Tasting Menu.  We both found the food to be excessively salty and very average overall.

Against our better judgement, we decided to order dessert. The tiramisu was too soupy/soggy and was probably the worst I have ever had.

The server never offered to refill our beverages and never asked if we were enjoying our meal. They ignored us for most of the evening. 

While the bathroom was clean there were no hand towels at all. 

It then took us a very long time to get the bill because the servers continued to avoid us.

We arrived for dinner at 8pm and left at 11:45pm. Unbelievably long dinner for food that was less than good for the price we paid.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Wish we had gone some place else for special occasion,Aug 2016 •,"I really wanted to like this place, we had our 10 year anniversary in Rome and after I found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays, we decided this would be perfect. 
Now we were a party of 4, 2 ordered the Truffle tasting menu, one the land menu and the other they created a truffle tasting menu for vegetarians, all with matching wines... bill came to 420 odd Euros...so wasn't a cheap meal but nor was is great...

Firstly and perhaps those that don't order the truffles will get a better experience but I found the menu to be unimaginative and merely they just put slices of truffle on everything. It started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato, compliments of the chef they said...um ok wasn't particularly tasty I left half of mine. 
then came the tasting plate, this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes, a plate segmented into 3 with a cold battered pumpkin flower, a burrata, and the poorest excuse of steak tartar I have ever seen. simply a square of raw mince and 3 slices of truffle, no capers, nothing else. 
the pasta was presented , two of them , however they tasted exactly the same...i liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate... this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasn't very nice.
Next the mains...2 tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle, on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start, and a beef cheek thing, which was nice, but some what confused in the whole tasting menu...

You did however get a very good amount of truffles...this I can't fault them of... I however would recommend that people don't do the tasting menu, rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or 2 with truffles..

Finally we had what will perhaps be the worst Tiramisu I have every ordered, it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on top....not nice, maybe at the Cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant.

Now the final and somewhat laughable moment, some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles, they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles ....how much we ask ...600 euro a kilo....umm no
Next morning we go to Campo Di Fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy, price 180 euro a kilo.....

So in short no I wouldn't recommend dining here, glad we caught up with our friends, just wish it was a better meal. I am sure my experience won't stop people from attending, and perhaps we  ordered poorly, I just didn't like it for the reasons given above.","Wish we had gone some place else for special occasion I really wanted to like this place, we had our 10 year anniversary in Rome and after I found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays, we decided this would be perfect.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing on our final night in Rome,May 2016 •,"We had booked our table at Ad Hoc some time in advance of our trip to Rome and decided we would keep it as our final night treat. We were invited to the pre-meal truffle tasting which was a nice touch and this started our evening off well with a free glass of prosecco to go with it. First impressions were good at the restaurant with another free glass of prosecco as we perused the menu. The wine list was extensive but there were choices for all palates and budgets, and we were very happy with our choice. Unfortunately that's where our positive experiences ended. We were left feeling very underwhelmed with the food when it arrived - whilst it looked good visually it simply lacked in taste. My pasta dish was nice but steak for main was cold on arrival. My girlfriend chose a truffle pasta that was far from impressive (and it should have been for the price!) and she couldn't eat the suckling pork chosen for mains - it came with no accompaniments meaning you had simply 2 big bits of meat on a plate). The staff offered to get an alternative as we didn't like the pork, but we had lost faith and decided against it. For the same reason we chose not to get dessert. The restaurant knocked off half the cost of the pork main from our bill, which was appreciated, but honestly we'd rather have paid full price and enjoyed our meal. After having high hopes it feels like the restaurant is a little style over substance. With sadness, this was a very disappointing end to our trip. It says something when you're happier with your gelato on the way home...","Disappointing on our final night in Rome We had booked our table at Ad Hoc some time in advance of our trip to Rome and decided we would keep it as our final night treat.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Minority Report,Feb 2016 •,"For restaurants as highly regarded as Ad Hoc, the majority of Tripadvisor reviews gush with unbridled delight, while a tiny minority will tell you it's all hype and a waste of money. Sadly, this time I have to side with the naysayers. 

There were three of us. Two ordered tasting menus paired with wines; one ordered a la cart. The consensus: no interesting flavors in anything we tried, salt being the dominant (and only clearly discernible) one. We did not complain, but it felt like the staff knew the kitchen was underperforming; everyone around was plied with multiple freebies. We received complimentary sparkling wine with a pre-appetizer, a pre-desert and a post-desert, an extra desert wine and a take home bag of goodies. The restaurant is very cute, has a nice vibe, and an interesting sounding menu that offers creative alternatives to traditional Roman food. It has an impressive wine collection and accommodating staff. It could have been a wonderful place—if it served good food. 

The cranky naysayers are prone to utter things like: ""It was the worst meal we had in ... "" Unfortunately, even this unkind sentence applies to our experience as well. During our 5-day Roman holiday, it was the worst meal we had. That is even taking into account that some of our meals were totally un-fancy, like a salmon sandwich served on a paper plate. But it was a pretty damn tasty sandwich. Since it is impossible to build a great reputation by serving mediocre food, I conclude that Ad Hoc had better days. In view of that, I don't know how to interpret our experience. Exploiting old, but now badly faded glory? Having a really bad day? The chef quit in the morning? Well, I won't find out, since a return visit is rather unlikely.","Minority Report For restaurants as highly regarded as Ad Hoc, the majority of Tripadvisor reviews gush with unbridled delight, while a tiny minority will tell you it's all hype and a waste of money.

Additionally there was only one type of truffle available which meant we didnt opt for this tasting menu. All of the food itself was bland and lacked seasoning with the exception of the pasta course and a number of dishes were cooked terribly. The beef cheek for example was like chewing leather despite being such a tender cut of meat. The service was also awful, with one of the waitresses contstantly slamming down our dishes and having a serious attitude problem. The only saving grace about this place is that the wines are fantastic and are very reasonably priced alongside the tasting menu.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,So disappointing it hearts...,Nov 2015 •,"We ended up here after reading very good reviews on Trip Advisor but our dinner was an experience of tasteless disappointing food.
After we were seated we had to wait about 10 minutes until we were approached and handed over the menus. 
For first course we ordered a home made smoked salmon and pumpkin flowers. The salmon dish was BAD. It was placed on tasteless anemic small cubes of potatoes and carrots and on top if it was a yogurt sauce. The pumpkin flowers were served deep fried with the same yogurt sauce - very very BAD dish. We left most of the food on the plat but the waitress didn't even wondered why.
For the mains we ordered truffle dishes. A polenta with truffles and truffled pasta.
The polenta was tasteless. It was made out of corn flower and not from a fresh corn. The result was s mushy unpleasant chunk of corn flower purée.
The pasta was surprisingly good and it was the only food we completed eating.
After clearing the table from the main courses we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a waitress to approach us. After loosing hope to get someone's attention, we gave up desert and ask for the bill.
The only positive element at this place was the wide selection of wines they offer, unfortunately, it doesn't come with  a sommelier to assist the dinners. 
Overall it was a a very disappointing experience and the high rating the place is an unexplainable mystery.","So disappointing it hearts... We ended up here after reading very good reviews on Trip Advisor but our dinner was an experience of tasteless disappointing food.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Underwhelming,Sept 2015 •,"Firstly I'd just like to stress how excellent the staff were, very friendly,  great english and excellent at helping you pick a wine to your tastes.  However the food was really unimpressive especially considering the cost, 130 euros for antipasti, first and second courses and a bottle of wine, we didn't want to take the chance with dessert. The antipasti were the best part of the meal and everything else suffered from pretty big cooking errors that you wouldn't expect at an establishment of this calibre,  such as splitting the eggs for the carbonara so it was basically pasta stuck together solidly by scrambled eggs. Complimentary truffle tasting and bottle of sparkling wine were nice. Overall I would advise anyone visiting Rome to save your money and give this a miss, there are too many other good restaurants in Rome, many for around half the price with much better food.","Underwhelming Firstly I'd just like to stress how excellent the staff were, very friendly,  great english and excellent at helping you pick a wine to your tastes.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Last Dinner in Rome. What a terrible choice.,Mar 2015 •,"We were in Rome for a few days for the wedding of our friends, and we booked for Ad Hoc because of my love for truffles. I thought it would be the best way to end the trip - I was wrong.

Cooking with truffles is not the same as sticking some truffle shavings on a dish. This restaurant believes on the later. Besides this (huge) issue, the service was slow, borderline rude and generally not in line with the prices of the menus.

The food itself was nothing more than average - every other meal we had in Rome was better - and I deeply regret visiting and above all convincing two of our friends to join us.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Disappointing,Jul 2015 •,"Our baseline for comparing ""fine dining"" restaurants while traveling is what we are used to in San Francisco where what we consider ""excellent"" would include the Slanted Door, Foreign Cinema, etc.
By that standard, Ad Hoc was a major disappointment.

Having enjoyed at Ciampini (above the Spanish Steps), on a previous evening, what was hands down the best duck breast I have ever had, I was looking for something at least as close in quality. So I tried duck breast at Ad Hoc and found it tough and pretty much tasteless (other than a truffle adornment). My spouse had veal stuffed rabbit which was mostly veal (dry ground meat) and little rabbit. 

Pasta with truffles and a sampler antipasti were good. But the main courses were just so sub par.

The wine selection was varied but I found the prices (at least of those wines with which I am familiar) to be high (even compared to other restaurants). There was no real sommelier and the waitress, despite knowing something about the wines they serve, had no knowledge of world wines like the California Pinot Noirs we were hoping to find a like offering for.

A well behaved toddler at an adjacent table eventually started to lose interest in remaining well behaved (as is reasonably expected) and that detracted as much from the fine dining experience as did the seating of male guests in shorts.  

Rounding out my unhappiness with Ad Hoc was the ""air conditioned"" temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, which is well into the high 80s F. It was almost as hot inside the restaurant as it was outside on a summer July evening in Rome.

However this was only the beginning of our troubles. We were seated, offered a glass of spumante - very nice - and had the menu. Then for more than 20 minutes nothing happened. Then our orders were taken.

We got a glass of complimentary sparkling wine upon arriving and soon after a small teaser of cheese-mousse which was great.
We had scallops and tartare for starters. The scallops where well over done but the beef tartar was fresh and good. As main course we had the sucking pig that was again well over done and dry, also it had very little taste, it came with light fried and crispy artichoke that tasted good. We also had ox cheek that was a bit to well done.
Im happy we didn't go for the truffle dishes on the menu (same dishes but double price and truffle). With a good bottle of Tignanello (95€) the meal was 253€. For that I would expect a lot better quality from the kitchen!

And the ""creme brûlée"" was about a teaspoon of pudding under such an absurdly thick layer of uncooked suger. Just really not good.

The place is beautiful, and again staff is lovely. But the food was just terrible. And to be honest, it seems like a bit of a racket. You're paying for truffles and there was very little on each dish. So besides the dishes being poorly cooked, they didn't have much truffle on them.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Beyond Disappointing!,Apr 2014 •,"I recently arrived about five minutes early for a 9:30pm dinner reservation on a Saturday evening.  I had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday.  The reviews on Trip Advisor were relatively positive, so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers.  I understand that service is quite lacking in Italy and not up to American standards, but a simple greeting is not much to expect.  I observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full.

My guest and I were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly.  She sat us at our table, which faced both the front door and the service station, so it really wasn't the best seat in the house.  I was disappointed, but there really was not anything that we could do about it.

We were presented with menus after about a 5 minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables.  After about 15 minutes, she came over and took our order, including our wine order.  But then disappeared.  Each time that we tried to flag her down, she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables.

After another 10 minutes, she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available.  I then proceeded to select another wine.  She then returned to the table 10 minutes later with the new bottle.  The appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine.  I'm really not sure why, but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting.  

So now after 40 minutes of sitting at the table, we still had no wine or food.  This was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that I have ever experienced. This is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in Rome.  My guest and I ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business.  As such, we simply got up and left.  The funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables. 

Hopefully, if you're seeking out a fine dining experience, which should include superior service in addition to good food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Left Unnoticed,Apr 2014 •,"We specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here. It started out wonderfully with a truffle tasting in a private room with sparking wine. Unfortunately, what started out as an experience ended with us cutting off the meal early. 

We are a party of four and were the third table seated at our 6:30 reservation. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. We had the pumpkin blossoms, the seafood sampler, and the cheese tasting. Everything was mediocre at best, but presented very nicely. Once the appetizer was cleared we finished our bottle of wine and had to wait 45 minutes before our pasta was brought to the table. Again this was mediocre at best, but displayed very nicely. 

The wait staff never came by to fill up water or ask we if wanted another bottle of wine. Finally they cleared the pasta and we set in to wait for our second course. A rabbit stuffed with spiced veal. Needless to say we never made it that far. At 9pm we had to get up and track the manager down, whom never once came over to check on us, and tell her we were done. 

The consolation was sending the head waitress over to offer a sparkling wine. For all the hype and the price you're paying, this was absolutely unacceptable and unenjoyable. We were very disappointed after all the high reviews here on trip advisor. 

Beware as the entire audience was foreigners and there was never a wait. A restaurant rated this highly should be reservation only.","Left Unnoticed We specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Would NOT recommend,Feb 2022 •,"My boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome. We had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go, we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail, as it was fully booked. Having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly-ish blonde lady (in a rather short skirt!) and were shown to our table. We were seated for at least 5 minutes, if not more, before anyone came over to offer us a menu/drink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation. We finally had sight of a menu, not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening. We placed our order and thought all was well, until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was 'confused': not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for. We were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list (finally!). The apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of Riesling wine to go with out food - not before having been told that they 'might not have it', due to a busy night the night before. Again, not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience. After a long wait, our main courses finally arrived, although, sadly, all I could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides. We mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this (having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal). We were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time, during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff (curiously, both the staff members who had served us) engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests, slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved. As an aside - the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress (the same one serving us) had to question the food she was serving them as she couldn't remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what. We were then asked whether we would like a desert, to which we replied no and asked for the bill. We were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting. Upon delivery of our bill, we were also issued with a feedback form, on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible. The only saving grace of the evening was the bottle of sparkling wine which every female guest was given upon departure. We are a young couple in our mid twenties and are lucky enough to have eaten in some of the worlds best restaurants, we are not overly fussy but the service we received at Ad Hoc was absolutely disgraceful in terms of the way the staff were behaving in front of paying customers and we would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, we were offered no discount and the meal cost us €130. I urge you to think twice before you consider going for a meal here, not cheap and disappointingly average food but we could have overlooked this had the service been exceptional, which it certainly was not.","Would NOT recommend My boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Most expensive pasta dish ever!!!,Dec 2013 •,"I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and had a big disappointment. I ordered the truffled gnocchi that cost 25 euros and the waitress said:_black or white truffle? So I said white, I don't even know why. The food was OK and when the bill came they charged me 45 euros for my plate!!! So when I complained they told me in front of everyone that I should know the white truffle is much more expensive that the others, even though the price wasn't anywhere. You can imagine the humiliation. I think any restaurant should know you don't offer something that will double the price of the dish without warning the costumer, only if you have bad intentions of over-charging it. Thank God for trip advisor and the power we have of telling our story so the same won't happen to other travellers.","Most expensive pasta dish ever!!!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Average at best,Sept 2013 •,"Let me start by saying that I don't eat to live but live to eat! I chose this restaurant based on the raving reviews.  Well what a dissapointment. It was not a disaster but is was below average. The restaurant does have a very nice decor and ambience, nice jazzy lounge music (the same cd played in loop all evening, hearing the songs 3 times). The young attractive hostesses were nice but do not know anything about food or wine.
 We chose the Sea tasting menu with wine pairing. Instead of pouring the wine at the table, they bring you your glass and tell you what it is. The first wine, supposedly a Chardonay was terrible so I asked to see the bottle. They brought me a bottle that was not open and told me that was the wine. I asked if they could bring us the bottles from there on, they did not. I asked to swith the Rose wine with a Red to go with the pasta, which they did, but it was just the wrong type of red for this, maybe my faut. A couple of the dish we had were good, lobster pasta and the baby squid. The rest was ok or below average. I had asked to switch the creme brule deserts with the other two, which agreed and aknowledged but they brought us the creme brules anyway. 
 Everything about this restaurant is like presuming to be something they are not, everything is superficial. No reputable restaurant gives 10% off for booking online and thta alone should have been my flag. I have a hard time understanding how people can write that this is the best restaurant they have eaten in in their life.

I chose this restaurant based on the raving reviews.  Well what a dissapointment. It was not a disaster but is was below average. The restaurant does have a very nice decor and ambience, nice jazzy lounge music (the same cd played in loop all evening, hearing the songs 3 times). The young attractive hostesses were nice but do not know anything about food or wine.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Worst dining experience ever,Sept 2013 •,"We were looking forward to this restaurant, but it turned out to be a total disaster. We had to wait at least 40 minutes between each course, and the food was terrible. Only the buffalo cheese in the starter was Ok, everything else from our tasting menu was horrible. Both the taste and texture was the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Service was Ok, but very slow, we had to wait for 10 minutes for water, and 20 minutes for the bill, they seem to ignore the first time you asked, and only acts on the second time. We find everyone dined there speaks English, which is not a good sign for a restaurant in Rome. Two tasting menu plus wines and a stater cost 155 euro, spend your money elsewhere and you can get much better food for 50 euro for 2 people.","Worst dining experience ever We were looking forward to this restaurant, but it turned out to be a total disaster.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Everything about this place was disappointing.,Aug 2013 •,"We were really looking forward to our meal here, and had made reservations by email online before we even got to Rome for the weekend. 

I don't usually take time to write negative reviews but really felt that I had to in this instance. 

The decor of the restaurant was very nice, but I'm afraid that's as far as compliments for this place stretch. 

The waitresses were very immature and didn't seem to know anything about the menu. Either that or they just couldn't be bothered to explain anything to us. We placed our order and were not served our starter for 45 mins. It then took ANOTHER HOUR (I kid you not) to be served our mains. 

I ordered the smoked salmon pasta which was hard and actually inedible. I picked out the salmon and just sent it back without asking for a replacement, or refund before you ask. The whole dish was just a disaster. Quite frankly, my 7 year old can cook a better pasta dish than that which was served to me that evening. The pasta course alone was £15. 

The started, I can't remember what it was meant to be but it was heavy and greasy- possibly courgette flowers, I don't recall. 

I ordered the 2-spilt mains and chose the catch of the day and tuna. They were both terrible. Really, I might as well have been in Bella Italia in Croydon for the quality of the food. 

By the time we finished our first three courses it was nearly 11.30pm. By this point we were so tired and irritated by the poor service and poor food that we decided not to stay for dessert. Possibly the best decision I made during my weekend in Rome. 

£115 for 3 courses, not inc dessert or wine. 

Less bothered am I about the £115 that I won't get back as the 2 and a half hours of my life spent dining there that could have been spent enjoying a meal elsewhere.","Everything about this place was disappointing.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Ad Hoc...Ad Nauseam!,Jul 2013 •,"We chose this restaurant because Trip Advisor ranked it among the top (#8 of 5922) restaurants in Rome, Italy. 

On our first attempt, we were told that because we had no reservations we could not dine there that night. The following day we made the reservation and we got a table for two. The restaurant was not busy that night. The space was ample where we were seated so I re-arranged my seat in order that I will be seated next to my wife and not across from her as we had always done in other restaurants. One of the hostesses approached us and told me that I should not move my chair from the original arrangement and did not elaborate further. I was quite surprised because we had never experienced this policy and besides they did not offer to seat us together in another table, as there were many empty tables that night. Because of this event, we were made to feel as “unwanted” patrons.

It took another 20-30 minutes before we were asked about our orders. We also had to request for a wine list as we were not provided a list with the menu. When we asked we were told by the server, “Oh, you want a glass of wine?” “What kind? We again asked that we please be provided with the wine list.

We ordered: a bottle of red wine; “ad hoc” pumpkin flowers for starters; flat spaghetti with baby squid for our pasta; and sea bass fillet, for our main course. Except for the “ad hoc”pumpkin flowers, which were quite good, the rest of the food were not out of the ordinary and quite saltier than what we would have preferred. Furthermore, throughout our dinner, we had to repeatedly request for attendance to our dining needs including extra  utensils, water, and even pepper.

The ambiance of this place was replete with the plasticity of protocol demonstrated by the entire staff which detracted from the “Italian warm hospitality” we expected.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,The most fundamental of cooking mistakes!!!,Jun 2013 •,"I have to say that I had great expectations from this restaurant. I am always disappointed from the offer of estaurant in Rome: tradiational ones are boring, most expensive one often disappointing (a part from Il Pagliaccio, but it is ineed expensive). The worst restaurant in the world is in Rome (Convivio Troiani...). So, an acceptably priced, good level restaurant is sorely missed. Well, Ad hoc did not fill the gap. I had the gastronomy menu, to try their best effort. With wines... Lets start with the good things: some starters were good (courgette flowers, tartare's...) and the wines offered with the menu are really good. Than, the sore point: salt and some average cooking in the pasta and main dishes. Come on, the spaghetti in the parmigiano nest are trivial from one side, and a concentrate of salt from the other. A lot of the dishes were far too salty. The mains were not exciting, nothing really to lift them from a honest average. Not what I was looking for. Just a bad night?

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A must miss,Jun 2013 •,"This was supposed to be our big splurge in Rome. 
We were looking forward to our meal at Ad Hoc with great enthusiasm, and when I told my wife they had a Truffles tasting menu, her eyes glazed over. 
When we arrived, we were seated directly across from where the servers picked up their food orders, even though the restaurant was nowhere near full. They then moved us to a table that was perhaps 12"" further removed from the food station.
They later moved us to another room that had only two other tables occupied at the time. Why they did not seat us there from the outset, I have no logical answer.
After looking over the menu, 
we ordered a bottle of red wine from Sicily. When I asked to have it decanted to help it breathe, the server said decanting was unnecessary,
and was steadfast in refusing my request. This was a first for any place I have ever at.
When we we served our entrees, the side dish of risotto and truffles was cold. Midway through the entree, the server came back to ask how the meal was, and I commented that ""the beef was good."" And though it was plainly evident that there was only a forkful sampled from the risotto, the server never bothered to make an inquiry.
Though I have an almost insatiable sweet tooth, we did not even look at the dessert menu.
At that point, we wanted to leave as quickly as possible,
but that was a challenge as well. After waiting 20 minutes for the check, I got up from the table to ask a different server for our check.
I waited a week before writing about this experience, hoping that time would lessen its sting.
It has not.
If however, you are looking for an expensive meal where the attitude is that diners should feel fortunate that they have been allowed to spend a copious amount for a meal, then Ad Hoc in Rome may be your kind of place.","A must miss This was supposed to be our big splurge in Rome.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Not thrilled to be an outlier, but here is why we didn't like the restaurant",Mar 2013 •,"I am going to start this review by saying that I can not blame the restaurant completely.  We showed up  late for our already late reservation, and I think that the staff was not thrilled that we had shown up in the first place. But the situation quickly devolved from there.

My biggest negative  about the place may have been the mistranslations of the menu.  We were given English menus with Italian, which I can't argue against, but the translations were so bad that what we ordered and what we received were more than a little different.  For example, my older son ordered a beef filet.  What arrived was ground veal cheek with raisins and pine nuts. Which is what the Italian menu says it is.  They were nice about it and refunded our money,  but, for a place that clearly was full of British tourists, it seemed to be a major mistake.  An English menu item for suckling pig ended up being a rolled sausage of some form.  Since many of the reviewers had either a tasting menu or truffle pasta they may not have noted this but if you go ala carte its important. 

My wife had ordered the truffle pasta.  This was fine, but she originally received another pasta.  They did correct this error.  

Regardless of the menu descriptions, many of the dishes suffered from the ""one ingredient too many syndrome.""  

Other negatives may have been more temporary.  The restaurant was stuffy and hot.  Although our server was nice, the woman who appeared to be functioning as the head server was not.  I don't think she saw me watching her as she made a ""tongue out of the mouth"" face while gesturing with her eyes at our table.  Nice.

I do know that we our outliers in terms of what we think about this place and I do know that we were not completely innocent guests as we were 25' late for our table.

We didn't eat it.  We ordered some vegetables which arrived aout 20 minutes after we had finished eating so we didn't eat those either.  We asked for the bill and it took 35 minutes to arrive.

1\ the waiter was very nice and polite.

3\ got a 10% discount on the items from there shop

1\ very small and hard to get to your chair.
2\ was told there is a 3 week waiting list ( booked on the same day and took the best table)
3\ the experience takes at least 2 and half hours. (very slow service)
4\ the food was terrible, me and my wife could not finish any of the 9 dishes that was presented to us.

maybe because i dont drink, or i was ""over-hyped"" by the rating and expecting to taste some thing from out of this world, i did not like any thing about it, and i will never recommend it to any one i love.

i think the high ratings that AD Hoc gets is because of the free Champagne and the discount.","if you dont drink wine DONT go saw ad hoc in first place on the site so i thought it was good so i went there even though the concierge warned me that it was not up to the hype.. he was unfortunately right...

I have visited Rome maybe 30 times. I was astonished by the bad service and average food. We arrived at 8 pm and there was no one around to greet.... Wandered around the restaurant and finally some one came. We sat down and were given our menues and wine list.
For 20 mins we sat  and perused the menu. All good ,another 20 we sat and waited to be served . Finally an order is placed. We recieved our food. My ragu.. Well it was more stirfry. Beef strips than any ragu I have ever eaten.
The rest of the meal followed suit. Wine was slow to come out etc. I can tell you that for a 8 pm booking we had only recieved mains at 10.30 pm.  While our plates were cleared by 9.20. More than 1 hour to get our mains is little long. We  only ordered entree and mains thank god.
We witnessed the table next to us forgo the complimentary amuse bouche. Which was placed on her plate. Then picked up and offered by the waitstaff to the next table . We could not leave quick enough. 
I generally don't quibble with rankings but this is not a restaurant worthy of 1. 
If the food is executed well but not to my taste I have no issue. Thats my problem . Not the restaurant .
Sadly this was not the case. The food was very average and overpriced . Remarkably we paid a similar price for our Michelin starred dinner in Capri only a few days before hand.

Based on the number of outstanding reviews; wow, were we disappointed! The atmosphere is great, the service decent, but the food was less than mediocre, it was bad. We enjoyed so many wonderful meals on this trip; La Pergola, Trattoria Monti, Piperno; to name a few. All were delicious! We assumed it wasn't possible to have a sub par meal in Rome until Ad Hoc. The crudo course had no flavor; the prawn and oyster were actually gross. The pasta was over salted and luke warm, the truffle starters were mushy; lacking both texture and flavor. My lobster pasta was over cooked as well and I gave up half way through, when it started to feel like dutiful and not enjoyable eating. The desert was good... A tiramisu that tasted like the edible embodiment of a cappuccino.
My boyfriend doesn't drink, so no complimentary bottle of bubbly was offered to us. Personally, I like a good glass of wine, but food is most important in a place like this... or at least it should have been.","A giant let down!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Average at best,Feb 2022 •,"I reserved a table at Ad Hoc for my boyfriend's birthday dinner while we were in Rome. Booking via the website was very simple and if you still want to go despite my review I'd encourage you to do the same well in advance, as the restaurant was completely full when we were there on a weeknight. 
When I say full I mean that it was full of tourists like ourselves. So the ambience was very nice, but it was hardly authentic. There was one table of Italian speakers (who also seemed like tourists) that walked in as we waited for our desert.
Waiting was a big theme throughout the evening. We both ordered the Roman-style tasting menu and waited about 15-20 minutes between each of the 4 courses. 
The wine pairings were very disappointing and a couple of them were just bad. They only served wines from Lazio - three heavy reds, and a desert wine (which was undrinkable). The servers recited juts the names and didn't seem at all knowledgable about the wines. 
The food itself wasn't great either though it came in wide variety. Only one of three starters and one of three first courses were really good. Neither of the two main courses were edible as thy were too salty and overcooked. I also overheard the guy at the next table who ordered the same tasting menu Say the same thing to the server as he returned his plate. The desert was fine.
Overall, not exceptional and not recommended. I'd say average, but for the price (80 euro per person) I expected more.","Average at best I reserved a table at Ad Hoc for my boyfriend's birthday dinner while we were in Rome.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,A big disappointment to food lover!!,Feb 2022 •,"Go Ad Hoc if you don't mind articifical service and tourist style truffles menu.

I did lot of research before all trips for food and TripAdvisor is one good source.  I seldom picked the top 10 restaurants as it was rated high mostly because of the no of visits are highest, and the restaurant is likely a commercialized tourist place.   This time I made a big mistake to choose Ad Hoc because it is just 3 min walk from our Boutique hotel and convenient for dinner.

It was a total waste of time and money.   Food quality was much below average especially if you consider the price.   Bread was cold and nothing special.   All truffle dishes tasted alike, salty and could not match well with the pasta or meat.  Carbonara was disaster.  My lady girlfriend just touched a bit and left all in the plate.

Service was artificial and slow.  The only good thing was they speak good English while most local Italian restaurant not.   The waiter was cruel in the beginning and started to smile after her manager turned up to greet us.   But you could tell that it was tourist place kind of service.

We visited a small restaurant just around the corner the other day which was much better.   At least the ingredient was fresh and the smile was genuine.","A big disappointment to food lover!! Go Ad Hoc if you don't mind articifical service and tourist style truffles menu.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,MAJOR Disappointment...Terrible Service....Average Food,May 2012 •,"I give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.
My fiance and I dined at Ad Hoc for our last meal of our 14 day Italian vacation. My 3rd trip to Rome. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner. We were really looking forward to Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome. I now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor.  Before anyone books a reservation, I would urge you to read the less favorable reviews.  You will find 3 consistent themes:  Slow poor service, average food, high prices. 
Based upon the reviews, I expected the service to be extremely slow. It was beyond that...we and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least 30 minutes without ever seeing a waitress. 
A couple of quick notes:
1. The place is beautiful....very nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting.
2. The food is very average.  I had the cacio e pepe, sea bass, and Italian cheese appetizer....none of the food was that good. My girlfriend had a pasta dish that was good...but not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip.
3. The service is AWFUL.  We live in Los Angeles and I'm orginally from NY.  We are used to good and poor service in restaurants. I can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional. That was not the case here. First, we were seated at the same time as 2 other tables with couples and provided menus.  I noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...but no mention of wine.  I decided I would wait to see if she noticed.  30 minutes later she comes by to take our order....no mention of wine. 30 minutes later...appetizers come.  30 minutes later, appetizer plates are cleared. 45 minutes later main course arrives. At this point waitress asked ""Oh I'm sorry...do you want wine?""  I respectfully declined.  
An hour after serving us our main course, they finally clear the plates.  Another 1/2 hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Finally, after more than 3 frustrating hours I politlely ask for the check.  After 15 minutes...no check!!!  So I finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check. She responded very coldly...I'm trying to pay my bill!
To be clear....we noticed the same situation occuring with 2 other tables around us.  One couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service.  They were constantly looking around for a waitress. My fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me.  She felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for 45 minutes before a waitress came to his table. 
This was an overall regrettable experience. This place could be a great restaurant...but with bad service and average food and outrageous prices....there are PLENTY of better options in Rome. Save your money and find other options.  Beautiful place, but not worth it.","MAJOR Disappointment...Terrible Service....Average Food I give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Terrible service,May 2012 •,"I reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and I hope that I'm the only one who experienced this:

We arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were. It took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant - right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were. We were looking at the back the entire night!! This became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night. 

1) We were in clear view of all the dirty dishes, the chaos, the drama and the waitress talk - all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us. 
2) The time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than 30 minutes. When we finished a course, the dishes were also cleared about 20-30 minutes later, so we spent most of the time looking at time, trying to get their attention, waiting for them to clear our dishes, while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience.
3) I honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since I reserved a month to 2 in advance?? 

The service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable. It was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served. It is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chef's effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower, the restaurant just ruins the entire experience. I don't require the staff to smile and be exceptionally friendly, but the waiting and the inattentiveness really bothers me. 

I hope that the management will solve this and perhaps try not to seat anyone near the counter.","Terrible service I reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Shocked by the great reviews,Dec 2011 •,"I made reservations at Ad Hoc based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm assuming we were there on an 'off' night, because it was an awful experience. 

First, they could not find my reservation. I had to go through my emails for 20 minutes before they 'found' our table. 

More importantly, though, the food was disgusting! We literally left most of it on the plates. Mu husband had the ""Land and Sea"" tasting menu and I had the ""Roman Style"" tasting menu, both with wine pairings. I had such high expectations, but the food looked and tasted like over-salted, previously frozen left overs. My meat course was supposed to be Ham Roulades, but all I remember to this day are dried out discs of mystery meat on my plate. 

The best part of the meal was the wine, but the food certainly wasn't worth the effort.","Shocked by the great reviews I made reservations at Ad Hoc based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm assuming we were there on an 'off' night, because it was an awful experience.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Our worst dining experience in Rome,May 2012 •,"Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.
It was a memorable evening, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.
We made a reservation an hour before, although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead. There were empty tables the night we went.
The specialism at this venue is a ""tasting menu"" accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between 79 euros and 129 euros. We went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive.
Having been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at, tasted of nothing.
Almost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was 3 different variations on pasta carbonara. Again nicely presented but almost cold. I would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye. Therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates I told her I was disappointed in the dish. She said she was sorry I was disappointed.
We had been in the restaurant almost 2 and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of 4 had left before finishing their courses. As only one of them spoke English or Italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns.
When our main course arrived I again said how disappointed I was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost 10-30pm my appetite had waned. The lady serving said it wasnt her fault, they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so I offered to spaek personally to the chef, manager, owner, whoever was available. My offer was not taken up but several minutes later I was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would I like strudel. I declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall. She said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as I and he had enjoyed it and perhaps I lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked. My response was that I could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost 1.5 hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat.
She seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which I declined and we left soon after having spent 3 hours and over 200 euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for. They deducted 19 euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable.
On the plus side, the wine courses were good, not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality.
In summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in Rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices.","Our worst dining experience in Rome Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated Tourist Trap,Mar 2012 •,"Living in Rome for almost five years, we have explored the Roman food scene and have truly found some gems. Over the years though, we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered.

Now about to move from Rome, I got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants. Surprisingly, most of the highest rated restaurants I had never been to. Seeing this, I got ever more curious: perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in Rome? We decided to find out.

Ad Hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in Rome. Me, my mother, and girlfriend were excited. Rated so highly on trip advisor, I was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest.

The evening started well. We walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations. The waitress kindly welcomed us, and everything seemed to be going well. The décor was also deliberate, and designed, unlike most of the humble family restaurants in Rome, where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from Forza Roma and photos of Italian movie actors and actresses from the 50s. This was refreshing for Rome, despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced. 

The only disconcerting thing (so far) was the fact that there wasn’t an Italian customer in sight. A few English speaking customers surrounded us, and a German family was within sight in the other room.

After being seated, we were all served complimentary prossecco. The bread was notably good also. Not a bad start at all. The menu looked exciting as well. It is uncommon in Rome to find a chef willing to experiment. The menu contained twists on local Roman classics, as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration. I ordered the “Ad Hoc” gnocchi, my mother ordered the cacio e peppe, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways. We also tried a few appetizers: Roman style artichokes, fried pumpkin flowers, and some fried cheese wrap.

That is where the romance ended. First, one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down. I don't know any other way to describe it. We are not exactly wine snobs, but this wine was genuinely awful. We ordered a different wine and it was better, but still bad. The third was decent.

The appetizers, all fried, seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later. One of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature. 
The food, both appetizers and main courses, were lacking flavor. The textures were off. Everything was slightly warm, but verging on room temperature. Felt reheated. 

The carbonara was very very sad, some of the worst we have ever had. Strange bland gnocchi. Soggy fried appetizers, caricatures of Roman classics.  The best was the caccio e pepe, which was below average. Everything was lacking punch. Depressing attempts at experimental. 

To be blunt, the food was awful. Far below average for Rome, at above average prices.

They also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in, even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats. A depressing performance art. 

On the good side, the service was very attentive. Very helpful. No problems with the wait as other reviewers had described.. 

When we left, we were given a free bottle of prosecco. I am not sure if this because they thought we didn't enjoy our experience, but it was appreciated. 

Overall, this place is a tourist trap.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Uncomfortbale and disappointing,Mar 2012 •,"My good friend and I decided to try Ad Hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center. As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine.

If you ask me, go somewhere else!","Uncomfortbale and disappointing My good friend and I decided to try Ad Hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center. As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Very bad food and service - not worthy the money spent,Nov 2011 •,"You arrived 10 min earlier, and had to wait in the street, because they didn't offer any place to stay inside while waiting- just rude! It was November and very very cold outside.

The waitresses seem to be learning which is not expected in a place with so high prices.

The food quality was poor - I didn't finish my main course because it was unpleasant. Next morning I had an upset tummy.

It was our wedding anniversary, so they offered us a botlle of champagne, before we left, which was nice, but we're so dissapointed by that time, that didn't made the difference.","Very bad food and service - not worthy the money spent You arrived 10 min earlier, and had to wait in the street, because they didn't offer any place to stay inside while waiting- just rude!

She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again.","Pretty dissappointing.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome.","Sorry I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people.","This place lacks human decency My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ......

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening.","Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people.","This place lacks human decency My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this.

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"British-Style Pub in the Pretty Bércy Quartier. Micro-Brewery, too!",Jun 2014 •,"Best of The Frog chain of British-style pubs in France (also in one of the prettiest parts of France, Bércy).

The Frog at Bércy Village is located very close to Bércy underground station (about a 1 minute walk). Bércy Village, actually, is a short secluded lane with restaurants and shops on either side, not really a village after all. Bércy is the actual quartier. Close by is one of the many wonderful France attractions, La Cinémathéque Francaise (see my review). One more reason to go there.

The Frog Bércy is the prettiest of a chain of 4 British-style Pubs in central France, it's also a microbrewery. Their ales are British style (IPA, best bitter, stout - plus a Hoegaarden like lemony ale), and of very good quality. Admittedly, the prices for these beers are € 5 and up, so effectively even more expensive than in London. But then, France is the rip-off to end all other rip-offs, and beer prices can go up to € 10 for 500ml (not even a pint!). € 5 per glass are called ""happy hour"" around here! It's not even a tourist rip-off, because the French are always happy to rip off their own countrymen, too, in one fell swoop.

I had a couple of fine real ales there and fish and chips (what else!). The portion wasn't huge, but to compensate for that, it was small. The fish was of excellent quality, crisp, with a good bite and firm texture - the chips were a bit flabby, just like the ones you get at many British pubs. Home, sweet [spiritual] home. ;)

The decor is very pleasant indeed, and emphasizes the ""dual"" British-French nature of the pub. Despite the slightly inflated prices, the pub is extremely busy at lunch *and* dinner times. Well, it's a nice neighborhood after all.

Service is decidedly French, i.e. a bit snooty, generally inefficient and a tad slow. It's all part of the folklore, isn't it?","British-Style Pub in the Pretty Bércy Quartier. Micro-Brewery, too!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Kicks Wetherspoons into touch!,Mar 2013 •,"This is not your typical little French Bistro or Patisserie. It's more like the French version of Wetherspoons but with far better food and service. We are a family of two adults and two children and were accommodated straight away on a busy Saturday night in France. There is a lively and bustling ( but non intimidatory) atmosphere at The Frog and the service was completely excellent. The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.

Beers, excellent and there was a really good choice.

Don't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers. Funny how they can get it right in the continent? The place is huge yet we never felt crowded. If in Bercy Village then The Frog has to be a must try place. Highly recommended is The Frog.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people.","This place lacks human decency My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge.

Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Pretty dissappointing.,Feb 2022 •,"I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again.","Pretty dissappointing. I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Sorry,Feb 2012 •,"I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome.","Sorry I'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening.","Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people.","This place lacks human decency My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !","Stay clear of this place! After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano?

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,disappointing - after reading such great reviews,Feb 2022 •,"I was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ......

We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.

We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours!

The food was simply sublime every course a culinary treat for us both. 
Also received an amuse bouche and also a pre desert treat as well as petit fours!

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,4.5 to be fair,Dec 2019 •,"As you walk in you immediately notice hundreds of wine bottles around the walls, some fixed to the walls and some loose. At first it appears to be a cosy little restaurant but it's bigger than you think. Just after 8 it suddenly filled and not a single table remained empty. Not bad on a street which was full of nothing but restaurants. The general ambience was lovely,  buzzing conversation and nice lighting.  The staff were really friendly and even though busy, took the time to chat. Free glass of prosecco on arrival and a plate of petit fours at the end. The food itself was well cooked and presented.  I can highly recommend the cod starter. We shared a lobster spaghetti which was served up in 2 smaller portions and they allow you to have a couple of small portion mains like a tasting menu.  I had the beef fillet and the suckling pig. Both delicious. We marked down a bit because the Mrs had 2 dishes which were a bit dry and needed a sauce of some kind to make it more enjoyable.  Though we did put this on the feedback card they provided at the end. So a good 4.5 out of 5 and we would certainly recommend and return.","4.5 to be fair As you walk in you immediately notice hundreds of wine bottles around the walls, some fixed to the walls and some loose.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,ROMAN Tasting,Nov 2019 •,"We did a lot of research before choosing our hotel and restaurants for a three night Roman holiday.  Ad Hoc was out choice for the first night in Rome.  We walked to the restaurant from Babuino 181 hotel.  A short walk in a good area.

We arrived a bit early but they seated us immediately without a problem.  The restaurant is small, perhaps intimate is a better description but the table spacing and layout give each party ample privacy.  The decor is nice too.  It is essentially a wine cellar atmosphere with the restaurants wine selection surrounding the room on shelves with led lights.  

We ordered the Roman style cuisine tasting menu with the corresponding wine offer.  I though we would be selecting one item from each course but the menu includes everything.  We really enjoyed all of the food and all of the wine with one exception.  The dessert wine was not to our liking, but that was the only issue in an otherwise excellent meal.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Highly recommend this fantastic restaurant,Jul 2019 •,"I booked Ad Hoc after reading some positive reviews and some reviews referring to birthday meals. We were in Rome for a wedding but it coincided with my girlfriend's birthday so I was on the look out for a good restaurant for that night. Booking from the UK was easy and the communication was good, I was e-mailed asking if I want to pre-order a dessert as I had mentioned it was for my girlfriend's birthday. The day before the booking I received a call to confirm and when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken to our seat, which seemed to be the best table in the restaurant in my opinion, and we had a complimentary glass of sparkling wine each. Our host and all the waitresses were absolutely brilliant, so attentive and really knew the menu inside out. When each dish was brought out we were given detailed descriptions. We were given a complimentary starter which was delicious and we all ordered something different, so the sommelier helped us pair a good wine to the dishes. All the courses were incredible, for me the Pasta with truffles was brilliant, this was a starter on the night, and the Suckling pig was so nice. At the end of the meal the lights went out and the waitresses sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and brought out the tiramisu that I pre-ordered. After the dessert we got yet another complimentary dessert selection of home made biscuits and then just before we left a bottle of Ad Hoc's olive oil, which we had during our starter and loved, so this was a lovely touch. 

Overall unbelievably brilliant service, fantastic food and drink, can't recommend highly enough.

Can’t fault a start like that. Next, all the dishes we ordered were fantastic. I ordered the pasta with octopus followed by the sea bass and both were delicious and the portions bigger than expected.

The service was incredible throughout but at no point rushed. The waitresses were lovely and very attentive (but not too much like in some restaurants). We even got a free dessert thrown in which was amazing.

We decided to go to this well received restaurant. The service was warm and personal and they spent time to assist and discuss different wine pairings throughout the evening. Great!

The aim of the restaurant was be perceived as a high end traditional Italian restaurant in a fine dining wrapping (complementary  dishes, service, attention to all details). They succeeded very well being developing a warm, personal atmosphere with fantastic dishes. The pasta was in our opinion the best we have had at a restaurant in our lives! If they want to be more fine dining there are details to be refined (smaller portions, more structured service and attention to details. ) Don't interpret me wrong. The place is fantastic and the service and atmosphere is what we want in Italy. The wines tasted was a Nebbiolo from Valtellina and a great Etna Rosso!. Well matched to the dishes.
Small notes to be refined- Given the quality of the wines they need to be chilled before served. Now they were served in the same temperature (approx 25 degrees). A few minutes in a wine cooler (also for the reds) are recommended.

Firstly I would like to thank you, and your staff for an excellent night at your restaurant. As you know it was for my 50th birthday, and so it was a very special evening. From the moment we walked in “Roma” greeted us with smiles and showed us to our table. 

Nothing was too much trouble, and Roma explained how the menu worked, and if we wanted, we could change 1 or 2 of the dishes. The food was excellent, and everyone in our group said it was the best dining experience they had ever had! The wines were excellent too, and again, we could change them if needed. “Roma” explained in great detail about every food dish and the accompanying wine served with them. Which vineyard they came from and the grape used. 

We were initially going to go to Harry’s Bar, as I have visited there many times before when in Rome. May I say your food, wine and service exceeded any of these visits, and when we return to Rome, we will definitely be booking with you.

It started with pumpkin blossoms with ricotta and truffles.  For primo, tonnarelli pasta with butter, parmesan and truffles.  For the main course I chose the braised beef cheeks with truffles.  This was followed by a selection of desserts.  The wine pairings were just right, and I was particularly pleased with the Amarone served with the beef.  Throughout, the service was attentive and cordial.  As a parting gift, we received a bottle of their own branded olive oil- an excellent reminder of a dining experience in Rome to be remembered.","Outstanding Dining Experience Our evening at Ad Hoc proved to be fantastic in every way.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Absolutely fantastic!!,Mar 2019 •,"I booked this restaurant as part of my girlfriends 30th birthday several months before heading to Rome based on a lot of the reviews below, and I am so happy that I did! 

Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely waitress who showed us to our table and took our jackets. A few minutes later two glasses of prosecco arrived at the table which was a lovely touch. There is an extensive wine list by the glass or bottle and we opted for a glass of wine each (then another 2 more after our mains)

There are several options for dinner, such as the tasting menus, with or without paired wines as well as a tasting menu with  or without truffles for those who fancy something slightly different. 

We went for the Ad Hoc tasting of starters - beef tartare, roulade with prosciutto and buffalo cheese, and pumpkin blossom with ricotta and basil and they were all very tasty! 

We opted for a selection of mains (where you can try two different mains but as a smaller portion) I went for Seabass rolled in zucchini and beef cheek, and my girlfriend went for suckling pig and breaded cod fish. We were very happy with our choices as they were so very tasty and the portion size was just right. 

Upon requesting the bill, the waitress said she would be a few minutes. Upon her return she cam back with a chocolate and cream dessert with a candle in it singing happy birthday  - much to the embarrassment of my girlfriend! It was a lovely touch by the waitress/restaurant. 

I cannot fault this place at all - superb wine list, incredible food and fantastic hospitality!

The complimentary prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch and we got some great tips for our wine selection.  The service was extremely professional but warm at the same time. The bill was very reasonable for the quality and overall experience.  The gift of a bottle of olive oil when we left was a big but very welcome surprise.

Their attention to detail is amazing, I booked the Birthday dinner about month and a half before as a surprise and to top it all off, they brought dessert in with a little candle singing happy birthday! I didn't think they would remember.

All in all I cannot rate it high enough. Highly recommended, good value for money and you leave the place with a smile on a face!

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,The perfect celebration,Jan 2019 •,"I had searched through many restaurants for my husband's perfect birthday dinner.  When we arrived in Rome our concierge said that we should enjoy Ad Hoc but it wasn't necessarily a celebration venue.  I completely disagree!  The small, intimate restaurant designed its seating so that there is more privacy in certain sections than at many Roman restaurants.  The wine bottles lining the room make one feel like you have been invited to dine in a family's private cellar.  For fans of truffles, that is their speciality, and they do no it well.  The carbonara cubo was so good that my husband stole it and left me with his pasta course, which fortunately for me, was also excellent.  The lamb dish on special was exquisite, but the beef cheeks were also a magnificent choice.  My husband was also touched that the chef did also gift him with a special dessert in honour of his birthday.  The restaurant is on a quiet street and is completely walkable from several fine hotels, and it was open on a Sunday.","The perfect celebration I had searched through many restaurants for my husband's perfect birthday dinner.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A Dining Highlight,Jan 2019 •,"This was a wonderful dining experience. Upon arrival, we were shown to a private booth for our family of four and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco.  While the multi-course meal was delicious, what we appreciated most was how the staff bent over backward to accommodate our daughter, who is vegan. It's not easy finding vegan meals in Rome (aside from the ubiquitous past in red sauce), but here the chef offered numerous options for her and she loved them all (and the rest of us loved our cheese and meat courses). To top off this very satisfying meal, we were each offered a small bottle of olive oil as a parting gift.  Prices were very reasonable as well. It was a memorable experience and we will be sure to visit Ad Hoc on future trips to Rome.","A Dining Highlight This was a wonderful dining experience.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A little dissapointed,Dec 2018 •,"This is the eighth time I have had dinner at Ad Hoc, so needless to say, I am a fan. But the dinner I had last night was a bit dissapointing. For 250 euro a couple for a prix fixe
Menu, You'd expect to be blown away, and honestly, I was not. 
I had the black truffle menu, usually a solid choice. We started off with slow service and an amuse bouch that was a tasteless spinach purée. The carbonara continues to be as good as it gets, but a lot of the truffles were flat and fairly weak. The wine pairings were good with 3 out of 4 being stunning. The wine steward is great and she took the time to explain all the selections. The rest of the food was okay, and the suckling pig was a winner. There were three rounds of deserts, but I was too stuffed to really plow through them. The prix fixe came with a conolli that was great, a pannacotta that was blah and a good tiramisu that has somehow become a standard on all Roman restaurant menus. 
Service was choppy and once the high rollers began ordering truly expensive wines, they garnered all the attention. It was just not the friendly and personal experience that I have been accustomed to, and the evening was a bit of a let down. 
Would I go back? That remains to be seen.","A little dissapointed This is the eighth time I have had dinner at Ad Hoc, so needless to say, I am a fan. But the dinner I had last night was a bit dissapointing. For 250 euro a couple for a prix fixe

Moreover, the door is saloon-like, so that whenever someone used it, we enjoyed a complimentary cold draft…!

Russia,Pelmenya,Negative,Awful service,Feb 2017 •,"This place is in the St.Petersburg center, near Anichkov bridge. While it has good reviews for the food, we didn't manage to try it. The service was awful. When we arrived, we just waited at the entrance - no one even bothered that we were there. Then a waitress approached and told us briefly ""wait"". Ok we thought, if she's so brief then it should be quick. After a while nothing changed - we were just standing at the entrance, making people which were eating feeling uncomfy. So we asked another waitress how long we need to wait? She replied 20 minutes at least. Could you tell us this information from the start? We immediately left the place.

My advice would be to eat there only if it's half empty and you don't have to wait at the entrance with no one caring about you. 
Otherwise please go further far from the center - you will find better and cheaper food places with cheerful stuff waiting to help you and make you feel welcome.","Awful service This place is in the St.Petersburg center, near Anichkov bridge.

Russia,Pelmenya,Negative,"Cheap food, cheaper taste.",Jan 2017 •,"Service is awful and slow. If you order lunch, might as well prepare to eat it by dinner. 
What about the food, though? They only have manti, khinkali and others from the same line of ""food thinking"". So are they specialized? Far from it. The taste is as blend as a fruit smoothie, the dough from the khinkali came partially raw and, apparently, they have quite a lot of oil to use in their food. Besides being fried (you expect it to be partially crunchy), the khinkali came soft and mushy. The taste of the filling is overpowering and strong enough to the point you can barely eat more than one fork of it.
The aperitifs, though, seems to be much better, as the ""Mozzarella with tomatoes and basil"" came as good as you could expect for the price range (besides being quite oily as well).
They are not ""internationally ready"" as the drinks menu, sometimes, has no english translation and the staff had a hard time understanding me and communicating, resulting in one dish coming wrongly. They are quite friendly and try their best, though. Had no problem changing the dish without additional charges.
Have I mentioned that even the dessert is oily? This place should watch out as Trump may give them some ""freedom"" for the oil.

For an almost 5 star rating restaurant on Trip Advisor, the fame might have overpowered them and the food quality came low as fast as the ratings went high. Or the peoples food taste is just dubitable.
Would I recommend? Not even if you have no money to eat, there are better (and healthier, considering the amount of oil they use here) fast foods and bakeries for the same price range. Would I come back? Unless I need to fry some potatoes with my blood afterwards, nop.

Oh and should I warn you: the beer is warmer than my bath water.","Cheap food, cheaper taste. Service is awful and slow. If you order lunch, might as well prepare to eat it by dinner.

Russia,Pelmenya,Positive,Great atmosphere and great service!,Feb 2016 •,"Me and my girlfriend popped in here after wandering around at Petersburg all day. I had read some reviews on it before we came to Russia and felt it would be a good spot to try. We were both very impressed. The girl who greeted us was super friendly and got us an English menu when we stumbled with our non existent Russian. She was very helpful, walked us through all the different dumplings on the menu, showing us pictures on her iPad and making some recommendations. We tried a few different styles; Russian, Uzbek and Georgian and a vegetable platter. All dishes were excellent, dumplings came out hot and fresh! Super flavourful stuff. The restaurant itself is a couple hundred metres off Nevsky but it has a great relaxed atmosphere, soothing jazzy music and cozy decor. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone, especially any non Russian tourists who are looking for a less intimidating place to have a nice meal.

Russia,Pelmenya,Positive,Delectable Dumplings!,Dec 2015 •,"Whilst I would not recommend this eatery for dinner, it makes a perfect pit stop for a hearty, cheap and filling lunch. No one should visit this part of the world without trying dumplings, meat or vegetables encased in an unleavened dough which are then boiled (and sometimes fried). They are a historic food staple and cherished part of the Russian and Central Asian diet. At Pelmenya you can experiment with a variety of dumplings including the famous Russian pelmeni, but also Ukrainian vareniki, Georgian khinkali, Uzbek manti, and also Chinese dim sum and Italian ravioli. 

We naturally tried pelmeni, resembling tortellini stuffed with ground beef and then boiled; vareniki, crescent shaped crimped parcels containing mashed potato and boiled;  khinkali, large purse shaped spicy dumplings stuffed with pork and beef, boiled and then fried that contain a mouthwatering savoury broth, and manti, containing spicy minced lamb that are boiled. Other fillings, both savoury and sweet, are available. Our choices came with a variety of condiments, including fried onions and sour cream, all except the khinkali which are supposed to be consumed plain and without the use of knives or forks; you should eat them with your hands leaving just the ‘stalk’ or ‘kudi’ of the dumpling where the pleats meet, which is tough. We particularly liked the fact that you could chose how many pieces of each dumpling to try (you’d want rather more pelmeni than khinkali), and the menu was in English as well as Russian. 

The waiting staff were very helpful and pleasant and spoke good English, the restaurant has a hip, modern vibe with free WiFi, although I would not want to sit for long on the high wooden chairs, opting instead for a more comfortable circular table. There are a variety of beverages on offer, but surprisingly, only one Russian beer – Baltica - which is a something of a shame as beer goes so well with dumplings and it would be nice to see this business supporting the growing Russian craft beer and ale scene.","Delectable Dumplings!

Cuba,Old Square (Plaza Vieja),Negative,Not much there but expensivwe shops,Oct 2016 •,"We went there but did not stay long as there was really nothing there but some expensive clothing stores. If you are looking for some clothes or shoes then this is a good place for you. When I was booking our Casa I noticed many Casa owners saying they were close to this square, but where you want to be is near Obispo street.","Not much there but expensivwe shops We went there but did not stay long as there was really nothing there but some expensive clothing stores.

Cuba,Old Square (Plaza Vieja),Negative,A Square in transition,Oct 2016 •,"The Old Square is about as touristy as Havana gets. The people working the tourists are delightful and not overly pushy, but they do not have much to offer in the way of anything interesting. The Square is being updated and upgraded, but it has a long way to go. there are a few restaurants around the square, but again, nothing special. This review however should not stop you from visiting Havana or Old Square Plaza. It is all part of the experience. Stop and talk to the people. they are wonderful and very receptive to any appraoch to talk.","A Square in transition The Old Square is about as touristy as Havana gets.

Cuba,Old Square (Plaza Vieja),Negative,The Tourism Trap,Oct 2016 •,"Despite the other reviews saying that this is a 'lovely place to hang out' especially in the Beer house, just remember that over 30 families were evicted from their life long homes to make way for a PRIVATE enterprise. Despite it giving somewhere for tourists to sit and have a cooling drink, I personally would prefer to rub shoulders with the locals, not stamp them out! Also, I thought I was coming to a communist country where everyone was equal. But definately not! The 'upgrade' to the square has taken away all of its charm and yet one more corner of Habana is santised for the tourists. (I am all for preserving the natural charm and beauty of this Unesco Heritage city, but at a cost to high IMO.) PS the cost of a beer here is as much as a Cuban earns in a month. :(","The Tourism Trap Despite the other reviews saying that this is a 'lovely place to hang out' especially in the Beer house, just remember that over 30 families were evicted from their life long homes to make way for a PRIVATE enterprise.
